      <description>I grew up in Colorado, moving to Pittsburgh to attend Carnegie Mellon University for my undergraduate degree, before moving to Baltimore to begin my graduate education at Johns Hopkins University. I spent a few years in Boston while working at Amazon, but was drawn back to the Chesapeake and am currently living in D.C.
I spend a lot of my time biking around, occasionally taking pictures. While I do enjoy nature a lot, I am particularly into urban environments.</description>
